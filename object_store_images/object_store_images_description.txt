Object Store Images description

This plugin was written when I moved our Cisco blogs to an internal OpenShift environment.  Our environment had a max 4gb size, so we had to get a team inside Cisco build an object store.

Our OpenShift uses PHP 5.4 (way out of date) and the object store that team basically used the AWS 1.x SDK (again, way out of date) with I believe an extra option or 2, so this had to be written in a very old style.  It works however, and with it all media uploaded gets moved to the object store, and is referenced there.

I was planning on rewriting this for these samples so you could test it on a current version of S3, but I just did not have enough time.
